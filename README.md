## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Gulp
- Eslint / Stylelint

## Instructions

You'll need `node` and `gulp` to run and compile the project.  
Install `gulp-cli` with:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Then install all dependencies with:

```bash
$ npm install
```

And finally, to compile and serve the files at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/), run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

For an optimized production build, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run dev:prod
```

If you just want to build the compiled files without spinning up the development server and watch tasks you can simply use:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
