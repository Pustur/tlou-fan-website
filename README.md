## Instructions

You'll need `node` and `gulp` to run and compile the project.  
Install `gulp-cli` with:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Then install all dependencies with:

```bash
$ npm install
```

And finally run:

```bash
$ gulp
```

To compile and serve the files at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

For an optimized production build, add the production flag:

```bash
$ gulp --production
```

If you just want to build the compiled files without spinning up the development server and watch tasks you can simply use

```bash
$ gulp build --production
```
