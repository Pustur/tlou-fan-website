      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what’s left of the military. Despite the strict martial law, Joel operates in the black market of the city, smuggling contraband for the right price.</p>
      <p>Joel is asked by a dying friend to look after Ellie, a fourteen-year-old girl with courage beyond her years. What starts out as a simple job to deliver Ellie to another Quarantine Zone, soon transforms into a profound journey that will forever change Joel and Ellie.</p>
      <p>As they trek across a post-pandemic United States, Joel and Ellie will encounter different factions of survivors that have each found a unique way of dealing with the infected humans, the lack of supplies, and the threat of other survivors.</p>
      <p>As Joel and Ellie struggle to persevere, they must learn to trust each other and work together in order to survive the realities of this new world.</p>
      <p>At its core, The Last of Us is about the bond that forms between Joel and Ellie — it is the story of love, loyalty, and redemption.</p>
